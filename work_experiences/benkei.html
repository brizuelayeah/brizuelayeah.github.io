            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I worked there as an intern during the summer of 2024. Although this was not my first international work experience, it was 
                the fact of being in constant touch with my colleagues in English made me improve to the point of proffessional proficiency.
                Since I was curious about the kind of projects that were being managed (or had been mmanaged) by the company, I maintaned several
                conversations with my colleagues (PhDs, engineers, biologists, administratives...), who were always willing to share their knowledge with me
                so I can get a better understanding of the company business model.

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                In this company, I delved into the world of project management, learning about the different methodologies that can be used to manage a project.
                I also learned about the importance of communication between companies, as well as the importance of having a clear and defined schedule.

                From my IT side, it was here where I discovered the R&D world, which makes the world to progress. I got deep into science (especially AI) papers,
                learning technical concepts with the hope that will help me in the future to develop my career.

                It's worth mentioning that this was not a "technical" internship, but an "exploration" one about the state-of-the-art.
                I did not learn any new "technology" (apart from improving my skills in the office ones), but I 
                understood how important soft skills are, like effective communication and adaptation.

            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>
                My mission was to analyse different Generative AI use cases in the project management field, 
                so it could be used in the future to help the company to manage their projects more efficiently.
