            <h2>About the Company</h2>
            <p>
                Bitbrain is a company that specializes in the development of advanced neurotechnology solutions for research and industry.
                They focus on developing innovative reliable and user-friendly deviced for measuring electroencephalograms (EEG) signals from the brain.
                They also develop software for processing and analyzing these signals, as well as research within the neuroscience field.

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I worked there as an intern from September 2024 to February 2025, as part of my Final Bachelor Thesis.
                I was part of the Data Science team, where I worked on an innovative project that aimed to decode information about the cognitive state of 
                elderly people from EEG signals measured during sleep. I attended also several Data Science project meetings, being able to
                learn how data science projects are carried out and how it is the research environment from the inside.

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                During my time at Bitbrain, I learned how to work with EEG signals, how to preprocess them and how to extract relevant information (features) from them.
                I also learned neurosience (especially, from sleep) concepts and how to sligthly apply them to the data science field. I also learned how to use
                AI models, both deep learning and classical machine learning, to classification tasks. I also learnt how to evaluate models, how to tune them and how to
                present the results to the team in the most accurate way possible.

            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>
                My mission was to try to decode information about the cognitive state of older adults from EEG signals measured during sleep.
                I had to extract features from the data (both sleep macrostructure and microstructure), train different models and evaluate them 
                to see which one was the best for each task. Finally, I wrote a report with the worked done, and designed a presentation to show 
                the results to both the company team and teh degree jury.
