                The reasons I've been working on this website are the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To have an organized repository of my projects,</strong> both personal ones and those interesting from my degree. 
                        This way I can take a quick look at them whenever I want.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To show the skills and knowledge I've acquired during these years</strong> to possible future recruiters.
                        Sometimes, a CV is not enough to show all the interesting things and companies you've been working on. A portfolio website
                        is a great way to let the others know you a bit better in the technical field.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To show others students which has been my path.</strong> Between 2nd and 3rd year, where you have to choose a specialization,
                        I was a bit lost. I hope this website can help others to see which specific projects I've been working on and what I've been learning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To have an excuse for building one more project.</strong> This website itself is another simple projects, which has been useful to me to learn
                        a bit more about web development, and refresh those skills I've had "stucked" lately due to my specialization in AI.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To have my own website online!</strong>
                    </li>
                        
                </ul>
