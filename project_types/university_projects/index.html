                                We learn about several systems (ERPs, CRMs, BI and industry automation systems...) and how they can be integrated in a company. We also went into the basics of how to manage a project in a company
                                and how the different departments in a company cnnect to each other in order to get the best results.
                                Technologies: PowerBI, Excel
                                Projects:

                                Software project: in group, we developed both a web and mobile application from scratch. We had to learn new technologies depending on the part of the project each of us was working on
                                (web-frontend, mobile-frontend or backend, where I was). We also learnt how to use CI/CD tools. We also had to cooperate with each other to submit specific parts of the project in certain deadlines. 
                                I played the role of project manager in this project, ensuring everything was going properly with scheduled meetings and distributing tasks among people in my team, as well as writing the project reports.
                                Technologies used (by me): Node.js, Express.js, GitHub, Postman.

                        Artificial Intelligence I: we went into the basics of AI, like linear models, matrix operations, feature engineering, 
                        decision trees, accuracy metrics or how both deep and convolutional neural networks work. 
                        This was the first contact I had with AI.

                    <li>
                        C-Programming for microcontrollers: we explored the potential of Arduino boards and how to program them. We also went into 
                        the basics of how a microcontroller works and how to properly manage its resources, like different sensors or actuators.
                        Technologies used: C, Arduino IDE.
                        Projects: "Tu me dejaste caer", by Daddy Yankee, played by an Arduino buzzer.

                    <li>
                        Cloud Infrastructure and Services: we went into how Data Processing Centers and cloud services work, how to deploy a service in the cloud, how to manage it and how to scale it.
                        I had my first contact with both AWS and Docker, although it was very superficial.

                        Artificial Intelligence II: this subject was more about AI applications in the real world and how the AI market is evolving.
                        It was this subject that made me understand the importance of AI in the future of technology.
                        We also went into how to properly manage a project that involves AI, and how to test it. We developed a simple regression model to predict tch employees salaries and a binary classification model to 
                        classify (in my case) car versus motorbikes images via transfer learning. This lead us to unserstand the importance of hyperparameter tuning.
