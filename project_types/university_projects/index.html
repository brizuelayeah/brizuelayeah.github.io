                        <li>
                            Computer Architecture & Organization I: we learned the basics of memory management, machine language and how basic operations
                            are performed in a computer based on the ARMv4T architecture. We also went into assembly language and exception handling, which lead us 
                            to develop a simple Spaceships game, coded in assembly, to put in practice the skills acquired.
                            <ul>

                            Discrete Mathematics: this subject was divided into logic, number theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. 
                            We explored logical reasoning, complex demonstrations, set theory, theorems and algorithms for both cryptography and graphs,
                            everything described with the proper math language.

                        <li>
                            Physics & Electronics: we went into the basics of computer physics, like electromagnetism, circuits and electronics, both analog and digital.
                            We understood how logic gates are designed and how they work, and we also learned how to design and build simple circuits.

                        <li>
                            Programming II: we went into the basics of algorithm costs and recursion, with the main focus in backtracking and divide-and-conquer techniques. We also discovered new data structures
                            and how to properly describe functions in a formal way. Finally, we learnt about Make compiling for C++.
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                        <li>
                            Computer Networks: we went into the basic protocols, how they work, how data is encoded (masks) and sent (graphs) across networks and 
                            which are the main characteristics of each layer from the network architecture. We finally implemented a simple cliente-server system.
                            <ul>

                        <li>
                            Concurrent & Distributed Systems Programming: we went into how to properly manage threads and processes in a system, as well as how to deal 
                            with concurrency problems where a thread (that can represent an entity, such as a person, depending on the problem) has to wait for something to happen. We learnt about defferent strategies (semaphores,
                            mutexes, sockets...) to solve these problems. We finally developed, in groups, a complex Twitter system where...

                            Computation Theory: we went into automatons and state diagrams, most of the times linked to regular expressions, to know how string data can be structured and managed in a non-ambiguous way
                            going from one state to another. We also went into gramatics for these tasks, being one of the basis of language theory. We finally delved into
                            complexity issues and computing times analysis.

                        <li>
                            Systems Administration: we learnt how information is stored in a Linux file system, and how to access to that information by using virtual machines. We also went here into the 
                            basics of cryptography and how operating systems are started. We also learnt how to automate operating systems tasks.

                        <li>
                            Databases: we learnt how to properly design a relational database, how to query it and how to manage it. 
                            We had to deal with large amounts of data for 3 projects (like flights data or football competitions data) designing a database for each of them from scratch.
                            These was very useful to understand how data is usually stored at a first level of simplicity, as well as to know how to retrieve data from these databases by using SQL.

                            Computer Architecture & Organization II: this was the continuation of the first subjects about computer architecture, but now we went into the basics of data can be parallelized to get 
                            a better performance from the processor. We learnt about cache policies, risk management, and pipelining techniques for both monocycle and multicycle processors.

                        <li>
                            Human-Computer Interaction: we learnt how to properly design a user interface, how to test it and how to improve it. We also went into the basics of usability and accessibility,
                            as well as how to specify system requirements bot functional and non-functional. We also explored how to describe the functioning of a simple system by using sequence diagrams. We finally developed
                            an interface for a simple banking application for elederly people (taking into account usability) by using a low-code platform.

                            Programming Technologies: we went into the basics of Object Oriented Programming, how to use inheritance and polymorphism, and how to manage exceptions. We created several projects to handle
                            information according to modules and classes that are robust and reusable.
                            We also discovered the functional programming paradigm, which was quite different to the ones we were used to.

                            Algorithmics for Hard Problems: we went into how to properly describe problems that are hard to solve, and how to solve them in the most efficient way. 
                            This subject was divided into NP-hard problems, approximate algorithms, probabilistic algorithms and compression algorithms. This subject made me understand much better computation times
                            and the importance of efficiency in programming.

                            Data Mining & Warehousing: we learnt about the difference between a typical database and a data warehouse, optimized for enterprise requirements. We designed 3 datamarts, improving from the first to the last one,
                            to perform the correspondent queries in the most efficient way in order to show the data in a data visualization platform. We also went into the basics of data mining, whcih lead us to machine learning fundamentals like regressions or classification problems, data analysisi with statistics methods
                            and association rules, among others.

                            Legacy Systems: we explored the problems a legacy system may produce (or solve) in a company, and how to properly manage them by migrting or wrapping the system. 
                            We put our hands into ancient systems like ZX Spectrum or BASIC/MS-DOS to understand how they worked and how they can be managed nowadays (for example, by using OCRs).

                            Databases II: we learnt how to create federated databases, and how to deal with data that is already in different databases. We also explored the differences between several Database Management Systems, 
                            and how a database scheme can be derived from an object-oriented classes scheme. We also went into the basics of NoSQL databases and how to manage them.

                            (web-frontend, mobile-frontend or backend, where I was). We also learnt how to use CI/CD tools. We also had to cooperate with each other to submit specific parts of the project in certain deadlines. 
                            I played the role of project manager in this project, ensuring everything was going properly with scheduled meetings and distributing tasks among people in my team, as well as writing the project reports.

                        Artificial Intelligence I: we went into the basics of AI, like linear models, matrix operations, feature engineering, 
                        decision trees, accuracy metrics or how both deep and convolutional neural networks work. 
                        This was the first contact I had with AI.

                        Artificial Intelligence II: this subject was more about AI applications in the real world and how the AI market is evolving.
                        It was this subject that made me understand the importance of AI in the future of technology.
                        We also went into how to properly manage a project that involves AI, and how to test it. We developed a simple regression model to predict tch employees salaries and a binary classification model to 
                        classify (in my case) car versus motorbikes images via transfer learning. This lead us to unserstand the importance of hyperparameter tuning.
