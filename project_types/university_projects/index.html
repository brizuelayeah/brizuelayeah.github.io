                    University College Cork (UCC) is one of Ireland’s leading universities, renowned for its research, innovation, and academic excellence.
                    Founded in 1845 and located in Cork, UCC is part of the National University of Ireland and consistently ranks among the top institutions globally. 
                    It offers a vibrant campus life, state-of-the-art facilities, and strong industry connections, making it a hub for students pursuing various disciplines, 
                    including science, engineering, business, and the humanities.
                    <br>
                    The Computer Science degree at UCC is a highly regarded program that provides students with a strong foundation in software development, 
                    artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data science. With a curriculum that balances theoretical knowledge and practical experience, students gain
                    hands-on skills through projects, labs, and industry placements. UCC has strong ties with leading tech companies, ensuring graduates are well-prepared for
                    careers in the ever-evolving technology sector. The program also emphasizes research and innovation, offering opportunities for students to engage in cutting-edge

                    UCC is also famous for its connection to George Boole, the mathematician and logician known as the father of Boolean algebra, which laid the foundations for modern
                    computing. Boole was the first professor of mathematics at UCC (then called Queen’s College Cork) and made groundbreaking contributions to logic and algebra, which 
                    are fundamental to computer science today.
