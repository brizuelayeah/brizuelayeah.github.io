                <h3>UCC: University College of Cork</h3>
                <p>
                    University College Cork (UCC) is one of Ireland’s leading universities, renowned for its research, innovation, and academic excellence.
                    Founded in 1845 and located in Cork, UCC is part of the National University of Ireland and consistently ranks among the top institutions globally. 
                    It offers a vibrant campus life, state-of-the-art facilities, and strong industry connections, making it a hub for students pursuing various disciplines, 
                    including science, engineering, business, and the humanities.
                    <br>
                    The Computer Science degree at UCC is a highly regarded program that provides students with a strong foundation in software development, 
                    artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data science. With a curriculum that balances theoretical knowledge and practical experience, students gain
                    hands-on skills through projects, labs, and industry placements. UCC has strong ties with leading tech companies, ensuring graduates are well-prepared for
                    careers in the ever-evolving technology sector. The program also emphasizes research and innovation, offering opportunities for students to engage in cutting-edge
                    developments in computing.
                    <br>
                    UCC is also famous for its connection to George Boole, the mathematician and logician known as the father of Boolean algebra, which laid the foundations for modern
                    computing. Boole was the first professor of mathematics at UCC (then called Queen’s College Cork) and made groundbreaking contributions to logic and algebra, which 
                    are fundamental to computer science today.

                                a company has to make in order to decide, for instance, where to invest.

                                As engineers, we must have a strong math and analysis base. In this subject we went into 
                                complex numbers, sucessions and series, functions (continuity, derivatives and integrals) and Taylor polynoms,
                                among others. I got Grade with Honors in this matter.

                                Since algebra makes the foundation of computer calculations, we went into matrix albegra, lineal
                                ecuations systems, vectorial spaces and lineal applications, languages, groups, rings and fields. We were also introduced
                                to math demonstrations in this subject.

                                to develop a simple Spaceships game, coded in assembly, to put in practice the skills acquired.

                                We went into how processes and memory are managed in a computer, as well as how a filesystem
                                works among other things. We also went into the basics of threads, system calls and pipes. All the subject was tought from an UNIX point of view.

                                We went into how to properly manage threads and processes in a system, as well as how to deal 
                                with concurrency problems where a thread (that can represent an entity, such as a person, depending on the problem) has to wait for something to happen. We learnt about defferent strategies (semaphores,
                                mutexes, sockets...) to solve these problems. We finally developed, in groups, a complex Twitter system where...

                                going from one state to another. We also went into gramatics for these tasks, being one of the basis of language theory. We finally delved into
                                complexity issues and computing times analysis.

                                We had to deal with large amounts of data for 3 projects (like flights data or football competitions data) designing a database for each of them from scratch.
                                These was very useful to understand how data is usually stored at a first level of simplicity, as well as to know how to retrieve data from these databases by using SQL.

                                We also discovered the functional programming paradigm, which was quite different to the ones we were used to.

                                We went into how Data Processing Centers and cloud services work, how to deploy a service in the cloud, how to manage it and how to scale it.
                                I had my first contact with both AWS and Docker, although it was very superficial.

                                We went into how different algorithms (most of them, sorting algorithms) can be parallelized in order to get a better performance from more than one processors.
                                We also learnt about fractals theory and how to generate them by using parallel computing with CUDA and GPUs.

                                This subject was more about AI applications in the real world and how the AI market is evolving.
                                It was this subject that made me understand the importance of AI in the future of technology.
                                We also went into how to properly manage a project that involves AI, and how to test it. We developed a simple regression model to predict tch employees salaries and a binary classification model to 
                                classify (in my case) car versus motorbikes images via transfer learning. This lead us to unserstand the importance of hyperparameter tuning.

                                We explored the different computation times of password cracking algorithms depending on the defenses taken, SQL injections or buffer overflows, among others.

                                This subject was divided into NP-hard problems, approximate algorithms, probabilistic algorithms and compression algorithms. This subject made me understand much better computation times
                                and the importance of efficiency in programming.

                                We learnt about the difference between a typical database and a data warehouse, optimized for enterprise requirements. We designed 3 datamarts, improving from the first to the last one,
                                to perform the correspondent queries in the most efficient way in order to show the data in a data visualization platform. We also went into the basics of data mining, whcih lead us to machine learning fundamentals like regressions or classification problems, data analysisi with statistics methods
                                and association rules, among others.

                                We explored the problems a legacy system may produce (or solve) in a company, and how to properly manage them by migrting or wrapping the system. 
                                We put our hands into ancient systems like ZX Spectrum or BASIC/MS-DOS to understand how they worked and how they can be managed nowadays (for example, by using OCRs).

                                and how a database scheme can be derived from an object-oriented classes scheme. We also went into the basics of NoSQL databases and how to manage them.

                                We were able to create simple Android apps to access web services.

                                In groups, we developed both a web and mobile application from scratch. We had to learn new technologies depending on the part of the project each of us was working on
                                (web-frontend, mobile-frontend or backend, where I was). We also learnt how to use CI/CD tools. We also had to cooperate with each other to submit specific parts of the project in certain deadlines. 
                                I played the role of project manager in this project, ensuring everything was going properly with scheduled meetings and distributing tasks among people in my team, as well as writing the project reports.
