            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                Cognitive impairment is a public health issue caused by an aging population, significantly im
        pacting quality of life and healthcare systems. Recent studies highlight the relationship between
        sleep patterns and the development of cognitive disorders, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment
        (MCI) or dementia. In this context, artificial intelligence emerges as a promising tool capable of
        analyzing large volumes of complex data, such as brain signals (electroencephalograms, EEGs),
        to identify patterns and make predictions that facilitate early diagnosis.
        The objective of this project is to decode the cognitive state of older adults based on EEG signals
        recorded during sleep, in order to classify individuals into one of the main groups characterizing
        cognitive impairment: healthy individuals, those with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCI), those
        with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), or those with dementia (DEM). This classification task
        has been carried out by training multiple models and architectures in both Machine Learning
        (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), aiming to achieve the best possible performance on a dataset
        acquired by the Neuroscience team at Bitbrain. The EEG signals analyzed were obtained using
        the Ikon Sleep device, developed by the same company, which can be autonomously placed by
        the subjects at home or with the supervision of a family member or caregiver.
        This classification problem has been approached in three different ways. First, the sessions were
        treated as the evolution of sleep stages over time (hypnograms), obtained from EEG signals using
        an external DL model that classifies each 30-second EEG window into a specific sleep stage (Wake,
        N1, N2, N3, or REM). The classification of these sequences was performed using Recurrent Neural
        Networks (RNNs). Second, the temporal dimension of these hypnograms was removed, extracting
        characteristics (henceforth referred to as features) derived directly from sleep macrostructure.
        The classification of sessions characterized by these feature lists was carried out using various
        ML and DL models, both linear and nonlinear. Third, the sessions were characterized as feature
        lists obtained from sleep microstructure (EEG signals). These features, grouped by different sleep
        stages, provide a more detailed insight into a personâ€™s sleep patterns. Additionally, they were
        combined with macrostructure-derived features. Various feature selection processes were then
        applied using statistical analyses and importance coefficients. This approach, which yielded the
        best results, employed the same ML and DL models used for macrostructure-derived features.
        All experiments were conducted under three labeling configurations: Configuration 1 differentia
        tes healthy patients from all others; Configuration 2 groups healthy and SCI patients against
        MCI and DEM patients; and Configuration 3 separates all four classes. Thus, Configurations 1
        and 2 represent binary classification problems, while Configuration 3 is a multiclass problem.
        As a result, the combination of micro- and macrostructure features achieved 87.68% accuracy
        for Configuration 2, 73.53% for Configuration 1, and 47.47% for Configuration 3.
        In conclusion, this study confirms that EEG activity during sleep provides valuable insights into
        the cognitive state of older adults, which could be used in the future to improve diagnostic
        systems for cognitive impairment. The results obtained in this project are promising, as they
